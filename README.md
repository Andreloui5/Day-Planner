# Day-Planner

This application is designed to aid the user in their daily planning: dynamically marking the time of day with color, and saving and restoring the user's text inputs.

## Interface
This planner has an admittedly simple interface and styling. The user simply needs to input their text and click on the save buttonâ€” the program does the rest.

As the business day progresses, the textbox colors change from green (future hours) to red (the current hour) to grey (hours past).
